# EQT Full stack code test

Hello! :wave:

To begin the challenge, you have to have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed.

Next, run `docker-compose up` in this project and go to
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) when everything is built and ready.
There you'll find more information.

Good Luck!
